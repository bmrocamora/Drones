You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.
This file contains four sections:

## **Task 2:** Rebuilding Python Controller into C++

### **2.1:** Implement body rate control.

 - implement the code in the function `GenerateMotorCommands()`
 - implement the code in the function `BodyRateControl()`
 - Tune `Kp_pqr` in `QuadControlParams.txt` to get the vehicle to stop spinning quickly but not overshoot

If successful, you should see the rotation of the vehicle about roll (omega.x) get controlled to 0 while other rates remain zero.  Note that the vehicle will keep flying off quite quickly, since the angle is not yet being controlled back to 0.  Also note that some overshoot will happen due to motor dynamics!.

If you come back to this step after the next step, you can try tuning just the body rate omega (without the outside angle controller) by setting `QuadControlParams.Kp_bank = 0`.

### **2.2:** Implement body rate control.
2. Implement roll / pitch control
We won't be worrying about yaw just yet.

 - implement the code in the function `RollPitchControl()`
 - Tune `Kp_bank` in `QuadControlParams.txt` to minimize settling time but avoid too much overshoot

If successful you should now see the quad level itself (as shown below), though it’ll still be flying away slowly since we’re not controlling velocity/position!  You should also see the vehicle angle (Roll) get controlled to 0.

### **2.3:** Position/velocity and yaw angle control (scenario 3) ###

Next, you will implement the position, altitude and yaw control for your quad.  For the simulation, you will use `Scenario 3`.  This will create 2 identical quads, one offset from its target point (but initialized with yaw = 0) and second offset from target point but yaw = 45 degrees.

 - implement the code in the function `LateralPositionControl()`
 - implement the code in the function `AltitudeControl()`
 - tune parameters `Kp_pos_z` and `Kp_vel_z`
 - tune parameters `Kp_vel_xy` and `Kp_vel_z`

If successful, the quads should be going to their destination points and tracking error should be going down (as shown below). However, one quad remains rotated in yaw.

 - implement the code in the function `YawControl()`
 - tune parameters `Kp_yaw` and the 3rd (z) component of `Kp_pqr`

Tune position control for settling time. Don’t try to tune yaw control too tightly, as yaw control requires a lot of control authority from a quadcopter and can really affect other degrees of freedom.  This is why you often see quadcopters with tilted motors, better yaw authority!

### **2.4:** Non-idealities and robustness (scenario 4) ###

In this part, we will explore some of the non-idealities and robustness of a controller.  For this simulation, we will use `Scenario 4`.  This is a configuration with 3 quads that are all are trying to move one meter forward.  However, this time, these quads are all a bit different:
 - The green quad has its center of mass shifted back
 - The orange vehicle is an ideal quad
 - The red vehicle is heavier than usual

1. Run your controller & parameter set from Step 3.  Do all the quads seem to be moving OK?  If not, try to tweak the controller parameters to work for all 3 (tip: relax the controller).

2. Edit `AltitudeControl()` to add basic integral control to help with the different-mass vehicle.

3. Tune the integral control, and other control parameters until all the quads successfully move properly.  Your drones' motion should look like this:

### Tracking trajectories ###

Now that we have all the working parts of a controller, you will put it all together and test it's performance once again on a trajectory.  For this simulation, you will use `Scenario 5`.  This scenario has two quadcopters:
 - the orange one is following `traj/FigureEight.txt`
 - the other one is following `traj/FigureEightFF.txt` - for now this is the same trajectory.  For those interested in seeing how you might be able to improve the performance of your drone by adjusting how the trajectory is defined, check out **Extra Challenge 1** below!

How well is your drone able to follow the trajectory?  It is able to hold to the path fairly well?

## **Task 3:** Extra Challenges

### **Extra Challenge 1:** Improving trajectory generation with target velocities.


You will notice that initially these two trajectories are the same. Let's work on improving some performance of the trajectory itself.

1. Inspect the python script `traj/MakePeriodicTrajectory.py`.  Can you figure out a way to generate a trajectory that has velocity (not just position) information?

2. Generate a new `FigureEightFF.txt` that has velocity terms
Did the velocity-specified trajectory make a difference? Why?

With the two different trajectories, your drones' motions should look like this:

### **Extra Challenge 2:** Improving trajectory generation with minimum snap trajectories.

For flying a trajectory, is there a way to provide even more information for even better tracking?

How about trying to fly this trajectory as quickly as possible (but within following threshold)!
